# Dotfiles

These are my configuration files specific for my laptop. 
There are many different files for similar software because 
I'm still working on my setup so i have been trying many different things. 
These files are open to everyone and can be used freely at your own discretion.

**All the content is made using Manjaro as base distro, different distros will have specific sections**
